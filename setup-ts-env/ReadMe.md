ok lets breakDown all things

for init the package.json file i need this in cmd npm init -y
-y means yes for all questions
then i ts npm install typescript --save-dev
then npx tsc --init for init tsconfig
i write some code
then i can compile it into js from this command npx tsc
**if i wanna to run it directly i need to download ts-node package npm i ts-node --save-dev**
the ts-node is a library for run ts files as compile it to js then run the js file to see the out put
then run like this npx ts-node src/index.ts or the file location
